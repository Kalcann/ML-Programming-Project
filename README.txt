Yo, how's it going.

just some quick notes before use:

-- the neural networks are saved as '*.nw' files
-- you can use any image type
-- do not change the hiearchy of the Training data
-- there is no gui, apart from fileDialogue (gl)
-- sorry for handing it in late, I wanted to try training it overnight

off you go and have fun.

P.S. it doesn't work
